Abstract—Every year farmers experience huge losses due to
pest infestation in crops & this inturn impacts his livelihood. In
this paper we discuss a novel approach to solve this problem by
constantly monitoring crops using video processing, cloud
computing and robotics. The paper concentrates in
methodologies to detect pests in one of the most popular fruits in
the world – the tomato. An insight into how the idea of the
Internet of Things can also be conceptualized in this project has
been elaborated.

I. INTRODUCTION
For a progressively developing nation such as India,
agriculture is one of the most important sources of income to
the country [1]. It must be noted that agriculture alone
constitutes almost 22% of the country’s Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), which is indeed a significant number [2]. It is
due to this fact, that governments of several developing
countries set aside a large part of their fiscal budget for the
growth, development and introducing scientific and
technologically advanced methodologies for farming each year.
In a farmer’s perspective, such initiatives would assist them in
producing better yield and safeguarding their produce, thus
improvising their lifestyles as well. However, even though
such programmes exist, farmers continue to be plagued by
three major areas of concern – inadequate water supply
(irrigation), attack of crops by pests & insects and thirdly -
failure in properly storing produce which in turn might be
attacked by pests and rodents [3].
Over the past few years, a lot of research has been carried
out to overcome the aforementioned problems. Usage of cloud
seeding techniques and construction of barrages or dams near
villages have reduced the water crisis to some extent [4].
Modern storage techniques which include utilizing rodent
exterminators keep rodents at bay [5]. But when it comes to
prevention of pests or insects from attacking crops, the usual
practice is to spray incessant amounts of pesticides. Though
effective this practice comes with its own set of disadvantages.
Excessive use of pesticide can lead to irreparable damage to
the environment. Being at the top end of the food chain, this
would also create hazardous health issues to humans, including
birth defects. With respect to farmers, direct contact to these
chemicals often lead to skin diseases and prolonged use might
lead to cancer [6].
A solution to this issue, is by spraying pesticide on crops
only when need required and also by eliminating those crops or
fruits already affected by pests. This solution though simple,
would require a constant monitoring by the farmer which
would turn out to be infeasible due to various reasons such as
the absence of the agriculturist at all points of time. Ill health
of farmers might also constitute for his/her absence from the
farm. Therefore, in order to address this major issue, we
describe a novel, innovative and a fully automated method to
perform a constant surveillance of the farm at all points of
time, even in the absence of the farmer.
The major concentration of this paper lies in identifying
fruits of crops in their early unripe stages and also to monitor
them for any disease or pest infestation. If in case any disease
or pest activity is detected, such fruits could be immediately
eliminated in turn preventing spreading of the same to other
healthy crops. Pesticides, insecticides and also bio-control of
pests [7] could be utilized for immediate elimination. For all
experiments conducted, we utilized the Tomato plant (Solanum
lycopersicum), since it is one of the most widely grown crops
in the world [8]. Tomatoes commonly get affected, in their
growing stages (unripe stages), by a pest known as the borer
insect - Helicoverpa armigera [9], which is usually identified
by a black color hole in the fruit through which it enters [10].
In order to identify the same, a complete video processing
application using Java was developed and was deployed using
cloud computing which has been detailed further in this paper.
The next section describes few other existing methods
using real time video processing to identify unripe tomatoes.
Section III of this paper discusses the setup used for our
experimentation and also that deployed on the cloud. The
complete video processing algorithm developed is elaborated
in section IV along with the results obtained in section V.
Section VI deals with the future scope of this research with
some insights into further extensions.

II. EXISTING METHODOLOGIES
As of date, a lot of researchers have discussed new
methodologies to detect fruits and vegetables on plants
utilizing various techniques such as video processing and have
also explained systems which can pluck or segregate the same.
The first ever publication to discuss the same, was in the year
1995 [11]. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel idea to
identify tomatoes in plants using several visual sensors and
also to pluck the same using suction cups attached to a robot.
Unfortunately, no further explanation on how to achieve the
same has been elaborated. In [12] a complete explanation of
automatic tomato identification on plants using a normal laser
and an infrared laser has been described. The system though
accurate proves to be cost ineffective. [13] - [15] utilize image
processing techniques and stereo cameras to detect tomatoes
but involve complicated and time consuming algorithms such
as principal component analysis and K-Means clustering,
which slow down the complete process. Several other research
works exist which deal with the detection of oranges [16],
pomegranates [17] and the egg plant [18] but use techniques
not applicable to this project. Several methodologies to identify
tomatoes in controlled environments within industries on
conveyor belts also exist [19]-[21], but cannot be utilized since
these approaches do not address the problem of interference of
leaves, stems and other environmental factors. It must also be
noted that all the papers mentioned above deal solely with
detection of ripe fruits in turn helping in harvesting, whilst our
scope of research lies in the fact that detection has to be done at
the unripe stages itself. Also, there is limited amount of
discussions on detection of pests and more particularly the
borer insect.
The next section discusses the Setup used for our
experimentation in detail. The setup described can be used in
conjunction with the robot explained in [22].
III. SETUP
The initial setup basically consists of a camera which is
mounted on a robotic car. The robotic car is designed such that
it can move around the field, in the space between two rows of
crops, with the camera capturing images or obtaining a live
video feed of the crops. For the primary experiments
conducted, we utilized an Intex 5.0 mega pixel web camera
with an image resolution of 356x320 [23]. The camera was
placed at a distance of 1.5 feet away from the tomato plants.
The total frame rate of the same was 30 frames per second.
This in turn was connected to a laptop on which the main video
processing algorithm runs. Based on the decisions taken by the
algorithm, a robotic arm or a spraying system could be
designed to spray the necessary amount of pesticide on the
tomatoes. Though this proved to be a highly speed efficient
solution, the main disadvantage of this setup was the overall
power consumed. Since the camera, motors of the robot and
also the laptop have to be powered using a portable power
supply, such a solution would prove to be arduous to the
farmer, since a constant watch on the power levels of the
battery has to be taken care of and frequent recharges become
necessary.
In order to take care of this issue and by doing so, reduce
the power consumed by the system, it was inevitable to think
of a solution wherein the processing – the most power hungry
task of the system [24], could be performed elsewhere. In other
words, create a system which could wirelessly communicate
with the camera and the robot and perform the necessary
processing on a remote server. Therefore, in order to achieve
the above mentioned requirements we utilized concepts of
cloud computing as part of our setup. An illustration of the
setup in the field using a wireless web camera can be seen in
Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Illustration of the setup using a wireless web camera
According to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) [25], cloud computing is defined as a
model which is capable of creating a universal, “everywhereavailable”,
on-demand network access to a remotely located
shareable pool of computer resources that can be utilized with
minimal intervention of the end user. Any cloud computing
setup utilizes three major service models which are found in
our setup as well. The complete cloud computing solution for
our system can be seen in Fig. 2, inclusive of the three major
service model layers – The Software as a service (Saas), the
Platform as a service (Paas) and the Infrastructure as a service
(Iaas) [26]. The same has been elaborated below.
A. Infrastructure as a service (Iaas)
Infrastructure as a service basically defines the hardware or
the processor on which the applications on the cloud would be
executed. For all our experiments an Intel i3 32-bit core
processor was utilized.
B. Platform as a service (Paas)
In order to deploy the application created on the hardware
mentioned above, there is a necessity of a software operating
system on which the development kit or the necessary libraries
for the applications to work can be installed. In this case we
utilized the Microsoft Azure software as the Paas.
C. Software as a service (Saas)
The software application developed and which is to be
deployed on the Paas/Iaas is nothing but the Saas. In this case,
the Java application responsible for detecting the unripe fruits
and the borer insect using the wireless feed from the camera
constitutes the Saas in our setup.

The complete algorithm of the application developed has
been elaborated in detail in the next section.
IV. OUR METHODOLOGY
As mentioned previously, a novel and a highly speed
efficient video processing algorithm was developed using the
Java programming language. Speed efficiency was necessary
since decisions on whether to spray the pesticide or not has to
be taken immediately and sent back to the robot from the
cloud. The first phase of the algorithm deals with the actual
unripe tomato detection on the plant and latter phase of the
algorithm concentrates on finding the borer insect. The steps
followed for the same have been shown in the flowchart in Fig
3. and the explanation for the same has been described in detail
below.
A. Color conversion
Each frame of the real time video feed obtained from the
setup explained in the previous section is first subjected to
color conversion. It must be noted, that the frames obtained are
in Red, Green and Blue color scheme. Though it is of common
notion that green tomatoes could be directly identified using
the green color plane, it is not true. The main reason for the
same is the dependency of the RGB color space on brightness
[27]. Hence, if the brightness changes, the range of the RGB
values representing the unripe tomato also changes, making it
impossible to identify tomatoes under different brightness
conditions. Therefore, in order to compensate for this effect,
the frames obtained are first converted to a model known as the
YCbCr model [28]. The conversions are guarded by equations
(1)-(3) as defined by the ITU-R BT.601 [29] and have been
given below.
Y' = (0.299 × R) + (0.587 × G) + (0.114 × B) (1)
Cb=0.16*R-0.33*G+0.500*B (2)
Cr = 0.5*R - 0.418688*G - 0.081312*B (3)
Fig. 3. Flowchart depicting the steps involved in our algorithm
Where, Y represents the intensity, Cb represents the
chroma blue color component –in other words blueness of the
image devoid of brightness and Cr – the chroma red
component in other words redness devoid of brightness. The
color converted frames are then segmented using the Cb and Cr
components alone, to obtain the region of interest. Another
important advantage of color conversion in this case, is that the
amount of memory required to store each pixel of the pictures
reduces to only 16 bits as opposed to 24 bits which was used
with the RGB model. This helps to reduce the overall memory
requirement by 1/3rd.
B. Segmentation of unripe tomatoes
Segmentation, in image processing, is the task of
segregating or separating the region of interest from the
background. In this case, our region of interest is solely the
unripe green tomatoes and the challenge lies in the fact that,
this has to be segregated from a background mainly consisting
of stems, leaves and other artefacts lying closely in the same
range as that of the tomato.
Several experiments were conducted on over 100 images of
tomatoes, and it was found that green tomatoes have a distinct
range of Cb and Cr which were obtained through histogram
analysis. The histograms procured for the same have been
shown in Fig. 4. Similar histograms were obtained for various
images taken under varying environmental conditions.

Fig. 4. Histograms of Cb and Cr of the tomato images with the ranges
marked
Utilizing these values, segmentation was performed in turn
making the tomatoes black (0) and the background white (255).
Assuming ?cr1 and ?cr2 are the ranges for the Cr components of
the object of interest and ?cb1 and ?cb2 - the ranges for the Cb
component, then the segmented image S obtained can be
represented by (4).
0, ?cr1>Cr> ?cr2 && ?cb1>Cb> ?cb2
S(i,j) =
255, otherwise (4)
C. Noise Removal
As with all segmentation techniques, one of the major
issues faced after completion of the process, is the occurrence
of noise. In this case, a few parts of the stem and leaves are
picked up as part of the tomato and therefore it is necessary to
eliminate the same.
In this paper, noise removal was performed using a
methodology known as Erosion. A structuring element of 3x3
was applied on the resultant image ‘S’ obtained in the previous
step. Upon completion of this process, most of the noise is
obliterated but along with it comes a major disadvantage –
erosion causes even the edges of the tomato to disappear.
Therefore, in order to nullify this effect, we go in for the
reverse process – dilation. Whilst erosion is a process of
checking whether any surrounding pixel is black and then
making the pixel under consideration black as well (if it is
white), dilation on the other hand is quite the opposite [30].
Hence on application of the dilation algorithm, we retain back
the edges and the shape of the tomatoes to some extent. A
structuring element of 13x13 was utilized for this process.
D. Obtaining back the tomatoes in color
After completing the above mentioned steps, we now
require to regain back the tomatoes in color, so that further
steps can be processed. In order to perform the same, we utilize
the dilated image (D) obtained as a mask and logically “AND”
the same with the RGB image (C) captured from the camera.
By doing so, we now obtain only the tomatoes in color and the
background remains black. This can be further represented by
(5).
ExtractedImage(i,j) = D(i,j) & C(i,j) (5)
Once all these processes complete, phase 2 i.e. the
identification of the borer insect on the tomatoes extracted,
begins. This has been explained further in detail.
E. Identification or segmentation of the borer insect
The final phase of the experiment is to extract the borer
insect, if present on the tomato. In order to perform the same,
the color image obtained above (after masking) is now
subjected to color conversion once again. Since borer insects
are indicated by black color holes on the tomato, it is sufficient
therefore to convert the color image to an intensity component
(Y). This is due to the fact that, once histogram analysis is
performed, the pixels belonging to the borer would always lie
in the former end of the histogram. This can be seen in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Histogram of the extracted tomato with borer insect
Utilizing (4) and the new threshold values, successful
extraction of the borer insect was possible. An erosion
operation with a structuring element of size 3x3 and a dilation
of structuring element size 7x7 was performed to retrieve the
borer with perfection.
A simple counting algorithm could now be initiated, to
count the total number of borer insects affecting the fruit or an
area calculation can also be performed to find the extent of
destruction. The next section presents the results obtained for
the algorithm explained in this section.
V. RESULTS
As mentioned in Section III, all algorithms were designed
and developed using the Java programming language in
2015 International Conference on Communication, Information & Computing Technology (ICCICT), Jan. 16-17, Mumbai, India
conjunction with the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 and Java
Media Framework (JMF) 2.1. All programs were deployed as
part of the Saas layer of the cloud computing standard on a 32-
bit Windows system. Experimentation was conducted on over
100 images of tomatoes (unripe) procured from actual farms
and also from the internet.
Fig. 6 shows an example of an unripe tomato picture taken
1.5 feet away from the plant.
Fig. 6. Unripe tomato picture taken 1.5 feet away
It can be clearly seen that the top right most tomato has
been affected by the borer insect whilst the bottom left few
tomatoes are still intact. As explained in the previous section,
the first step would be to convert the input image into the Cb
and Cr components respectively. Fig. 7a and 7b depict the
same.
Fig. 7. Cb and Cr components of the Tomato picture procured
The image obtained after applying the histogram based
segmentation can be seen in Fig. 8.
Fig. 8. Image obtained after histogram based segmentation
As discussed earlier, there is an extreme amount of noise in
the image. The results obtained after the erosion and dilation
operation can be seen in Fig 9a and Fig. 9b respectively.
The regions which contain the tomato can also be seen
clearly. Once this process completes, the next step is to
perform masking using the mask obtained after dilation.
Fig. 9. Images obtained after erosion and dilation
The resultant image obtained after masking can be seen in
Fig. 10.
Fig. 10. Image obtained after masking
It can be clearly seen that the unripe tomatoes have been
successfully extracted and the borer detection algorithm can be
performed.
Extraction of the borer follows the steps mentioned in the
previous section. It can be visualized from Fig. 11, that the
borer insect has been successfully detected. The non affected
tomatoes have been completely ignored.
Fig. 11. Borer insect successfully extracted from the tomato
Further to this, a speed comparison i.e. a complete
comparison of the execution time of our algorithm with that of
the algorithms explained in [15] & [14] to detect green
tomatoes, was performed and tabulated in Table I.
TABLE I. COMPARISON OF TIMINGS OF THREE ALGORITHMS
Name of Method Time taken in seconds
Using K-Means Clustering [15] 0.794175
Using PCA [14] 1.45955
Our algorithm 0.46144
It can be clearly seen from Table I that the algorithm
designed and implemented in this paper takes a mere 0.46s in
comparison with the other two well known algorithms which
were used in [14] and [15]. This would in turn assist in a faster
judgement of tomato borer infestation and action can be taken
more quickly.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper a novel methodology to perform smart
farming and also to detect the borer insect on tomato plants,
has been described. The complete model implemented on a
cloud computing framework was also elaborated. It can also be
seen that the algorithm explained is 1.71 times faster than two
other popular methods of unripe tomato detection. Based on
the resultant obtained from the algorithms, a decision can be
taken as to how much amount of pesticide should be sprayed.
This prevents unnecessary spraying of pesticides as well as
safeguarding the health of farmers, consumers and also the
environment. Future versions of this implementation could
include a unique IP address for the robot, in turn controlling the
same via cloud computing or by a farmer elsewhere. In other
words a complete “Internet of Things” approach can be
utilized. Governments of various countries can adopt this
design and provide respite to hundreds of farmers worldwide.
