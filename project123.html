New technologies are required for safe, site-specific and efficient control of weeds, pathogens and insects
in agricultural crops and in forestry. The development and use of autonomous tractors equipped with
innovative sensor systems, data processing techniques and actuation tools can be highly beneficial
because this technology allows pest control measures to be applied only if, when, and where they are
genuinely needed, thus reducing costs, environmental damage and risks to farmers. RHEA (Robotics
and associated High-technologies and Equipment for Agriculture) is an EC-funded research project conducted
by a consortium composed of 15 research partners from eight European countries. The focus of
the project is the design, development and testing of a new generation of automatic and robotic systems
for both chemical and physical pest management. A heterogeneous fleet of small, cooperative ground and
aerial robots equipped with advanced sensors, enhanced end effectors and improved decision control
algorithms will be used. Initially, we are investigating three major scenarios: (a) chemical weed control
in winter wheat, (b) thermal weed control (i.e., flaming) in maize and (c) variable applications of pesticides
in olive crops. A preliminary system evaluation demonstrated that the intelligent sprayer boom
applied the control agent to over 95% of the target area and that the response time, 10 s, of the directinjection
system was anticipated in the sprayer system to ensure the accuracy of herbicide spraying. Field
trial results showed that the estimated cost for site-specific flame weeding was approximately 24 € ha1,
whereas approximately 52 € ha1 was needed to perform a conventional broadcast treatment. Thus, the
use of VRA (Variable Rate Application) flaming reduces the use of liquid petroleum gas (cost savings of
28 € ha1). The results also indicated that the control system, mounted on a prototype, air-blast sprayer
design, produced a precise system response to variation in the target features, an approximate accuracy
of 0.1 m in horizontal resolution and a rapid actuation response of approximately 100 ms. Workshop and
field experiments provide convincing evidence that autonomous agricultural vehicles equipped with
intelligent implements represent an important step forward for optimizing pest control applications in
sustainable row crop, orchard and cereal crop production systems.

1. Introduction
Agrochemical expenditures in the EU totaled EUR 8 billion in
2010 (ECPA, 2011). Increasing agrochemical costs place pesticide
and fertilizer users under increased pressure to reduce the rate of
pesticide application and improve application accuracy. According
to the European Crop Protection Association, agrochemical products
contribute significantly to food production; each euro
invested in pesticides returns 4 euros in crops saved (ECPA,
2008). However, pesticide use represents a heavy economic burden
for farmers and a substantial chemical load for the environment,
and it increases the risks of undesirable side effects on human
health. Sustainable agricultural systems require safe, effective
and efficient pest control operations to ensure the success of crop
production (Gutjahr and Gerhards, 2010; Perez-Ruiz et al., 2011).
In recent years, the European Commission has proposed many
public actions to seek a meaningful change in the agricultural sector
and to achieve a significant reduction in the risks associated
with the use of pesticides while maintaining an adequate level of
crop protection (Barberi, 2012). Today, many European farmers
and industries have embraced the principles of good plant protection
practices to provide a basis for their choice of pesticide ingredients
and formulation, dosage (and, if appropriate, volume),
number of applications, application equipment and method of
application. Many research groups have been examining the development
of autonomous vehicles and robotic technology in bio-production
systems to optimize complex agricultural operations
related to precision weed management. Examples include an
autonomous platform for robotic weeding (Åstrand and
Baerveldt, 2002; Bakker et al., 2010), a precision spraying system
(SØgaard and Lund, 2007; Gil et al., 2013; Tewari et al., 2014), an
automatic device for non-chemical control of pests (Tillett et al.,
2008; Perez-Ruiz et al., 2012, 2014) and precision methodology
for thermal application (Zhang and Slaughter, 2011; Zhang et al.,
2012; Peruzzi et al., 2012).
Overcoming technological challenges in information and communication
systems has allowed the optimization of weed/pest
and crop sensors. These sensors can be built with enhanced actuators
to perform weed control actions. Additionally, autonomous
platforms can be provided to move these sensors and actuators
throughout the field or location of interest. There are currently
two ongoing FP7 (Seven Framework Programme) projects in Europe
related to the autonomous navigation of mobile robots in agriculture:
Robot Fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and Forestry
Management (RHEA-GA no. 245986) and Clever Robots for Crops
(CROPS-GA no. 246252). Autonomous weed control systems are
the principal concept behind the RHEA project, which has a focus
on row crops and forestry. The objective of the CROPS project is
the development of a robotic platform capable of site-specific
spraying as well as selective harvesting of high-value crops such
as greenhouse vegetables, orchard fruits and grapes. Both projects
are large-scale FP7 European projects conducted by a consortium
formed by 19 (RHEA) and 14 (CROPS) multidisciplinary, experienced
partners from industry, research centers and academia.
These two projects seek to apply automatic pest control systems
to agricultural crops and orchards with the goal of improving the
economy and environment while sustaining rural regions by creating
new technology-based jobs.
Although several sensing technologies based on optical measurements
are already available for crop monitoring (Scotford
and Miller, 2005), most of them have been commercially implemented
using all-terrain, human-operated vehicles, which can be
considered to represent an intermediate step in the development
of unmanned vehicles or robots. However, certain vehicles currently
in use in agriculture are extremely large. Consequently, dangerous
situations may emerge if extremely large agricultural
vehicles are operated in autonomous mode. Therefore, an innovative
and more suitable solution may involve a fleet of small/medium
sized vehicles, particularly robotized mobile units, capable of
collaborating among themselves to complement their sensor/
action tasks.
The advantages of autonomous tractors over conventional large
tractors equipped with many different actuators and end effectors
may include the following:
1. Several small/medium-sized autonomous tractors can achieve
productivity equal to or greater than that of one large machine.
2. A fleet of small/medium robots is safer than a large machine
running autonomously.
3. Robot fleets allow for mission re-planning in case one vehicle
fails, whereas the failure of just one large machine will stop
the whole mission until the machine is repaired.
4. A group of small/medium-sized robots, each with a small number
of end effectors, is more precise and efficient than a large
machine with a large number of end effectors.
5. A robot fleet can be supervised by just one operator, whereas
large machines need one operator each.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 is devoted to the
description of several important elements involved in the RHEA
concept, such as the autonomous tractor and the communication
and location systems. Section 3 describes the new pest control
implements previously designed and developed in this European
project. Section 4 reports preliminary results of experimental tests
conducted in the laboratory and in the field.
2. Mobile units
The RHEA concept of autonomous weed control involves the
development of an autonomous tractor (ground unit) and aerial
robots to deploy a surveillance and actuation system over the mission
field. The ground units are based on a medium-sized autonomous
vehicle with onboard equipment for navigation and pest
M. Pérez-Ruiz et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 110 (2015) 150–161 151
control treatments. Due to the integration of Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) and sensors, each tractor controller can
receive its desired trajectories from the mission planner and its
current position from its own geographical positioning system. A
Base Station is located next to the mission field and is equipped
with a computer and software especially designed to plan and
supervise the missions of the autonomous tractors.
2.1. Autonomous tractor
Three commercial tractors have been adapted for autonomous
operation. Each autonomous tractor has been furnished with a perception
and actuation system targeting the mission field. The platform
of the autonomous vehicle is a conventional 38 kW tractor
(New Holland Boomer T3050, 3-point hitch) that has been retrofitted
for autonomous agricultural operation. Several hydraulic and
mechanical modifications have been made to the commercial tractor
to install new systems. The seat, the brake pedals, the throttle
pedal and handbrake have been removed, as they are no longer
used. These modifications have furnished additional space in the
cabin to house the electronics. The cabin of the original tractor
has been cut and the roof lowered (see Fig. 1). The roof can be easily
removed from the cabin structure to access the electronics
inside the cabin. Due to the cabin modifications, new doors and
new windows have been installed to soundproof the cabin. The
cabin ventilator has been retained and can be activated with a button
located on the left side of the roof inside the cabin.
A frame has been installed on the retrofitted tractor to mount
most of the necessary equipment, including the on-board computers,
inertial measurement unit, modem for communications, realtime
kinematics (RTK)-GNSS receiver (BX982, Trimble Navigation
Ltd., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for navigation and connector boxes. The
motion of the autonomous tractor has three primary degrees of
freedom (longitudinal, lateral and yaw). The tractor control is
responsible for sensing the vehicle location and heading angle.
Fig. 2 shows the equipment setup used in the field experiments.
A GNSS-based navigation system has been designed and is used
for automatic row guidance of the autonomous tractor. The trajectory
generated by the path planner needs to link the current vehicle
location (determined by local plane coordinates) with the
desired target point. The location of the tractor is readily available
using the RTK-GNSS receiver mounted onboard. The coordinates of
the target point are calculated by the navigation planner. For
example, if a parallel track system has generated a series of waypoints
parallel to the user-defined reference straight line (the A–
B line), the navigation engine of the vehicle compares its current
position with the location of the subsequent point of the trajectory
and deduces the best steering command required to reach the targeted
waypoint. This comparison between the real position and the
desired point is expressed in terms of two fundamental parameters:
offset error (lateral displacement) and heading error.
To configure a fully autonomous agricultural system capable of
ensuring precise navigation, it is necessary to configure a framework
(hardware and software) to merge perception (accurate vehicle
positioning) and action (steering and speed control). The
hardware framework should be modular, flexible and robust,
exhibiting real time-multitasking features and integrating modern
standard communication protocols. Specifically, the vehicle controller
runs on a cRIO 9082 NI computer, and the control algorithms
were developed using the LabVIEW™ (National
Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) graphical programming environment
(Emmi et al., 2013).
Preliminary experiments were conducted to verify the performance
of the autonomous tractor when it was navigated in a

straight line. Field tests were performed over a one-week period
during the winter of 2013 at the Center for Automation and Robotics
field experimental site of the Spanish National Research Council
(CISC) in Madrid, Spain (latitude 40.25835007 N, longitude
3.44696865 W). The following three criteria were used to select
the test plot: (i) a plot that was almost flat, (ii) a plot large enough
for five 20-m rows and (iii) a plot that was within the range of the
Base Station used in the experiment. Each dynamic test consisted
of five straight-line passes with a length of 20 m (Fig. 3). Two
points (‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’) for each straight line were generated as actual
geospatial locations by an RTK-GNSS receiver using a handheld
surveying system interfaced with an RTK-GPS rover (Model
Bx982, Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The GNSS
coordinates for points A and B were obtained by placing the bottom
tip of the 2-m GPS antenna survey pole against the soil surface
and holding the pole vertical with the aid of a bubble level. The
WGS 84 Datum was used during all RTK-GPS measurements.
Points A and B were established for a dual purpose: (a) the
straight-line mission planning for the autonomous tractor and (b)
a straight line defined on the ground. All passes were conducted
at a travel speed of 2.5 km h1.
2.2. Communications and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
The high-level communication architecture of the RHEA system
integrates two different networks: (i) an on-board IP-based network
deployed on each Ground Mobile Unit, and (ii) a fleet IP-based network
connecting Ground Mobile Units and the Base Station. Onboard
IP-based network is realized in the Ground Mobile Unit by
means of IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network (LAN) connected by a managed
Ethernet switch. The switch provides built-in management
functionalities that enable the configuration of QoS parameters,
e.g., traffic prioritization, as well as alarming in the case that the configured
interfaces do not function correctly. On the other hand,
robust wireless communication is central support capability of this
system; as mobile units move within the field, they exchange status
information with the supervision system (running in the Base Station)
or among themselves. The fleet communication system is
based on a commercial Off-The-Shelf (OTS) programmable wireless
router (model ALIX 3D2, PCEngines GmbH, Glattbrugg, Switzerland)
that featured an AMD Geode LX800 500 MHz CPU, 256 MB of DDR
RAM, a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet port and two miniPCI slots. These slots
are used to add two wireless, IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11n, hardware
modules to the system. The two main wireless IEEE 802.11
communication technologies are chosen to operate in unlicensed
industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency bands. To improve
their robustness and resilience to interference and fading effects, the
modules operate in different sub-bands: one IEEE 802.11n module
utilizes channels in the most commonly used 2.4 GHzband, whereas
the other module, IEEE 802.11a, operates in the 5 GHz band. The
embedded board and the wireless hardware modules are protected
by an IP65 aluminum enclosure. Power is supplied to the system by a

nal adapter is used to connect 12 VDC voltage to the CAT6-shielded
Ethernet cable.
The RHEA communication system provides two main communication
services to the application developer: (i) the Best-Effort (BE)
service that provides high throughput and transmission range, but
without guaranteed transmission time, and (ii) the Real-Time (RT)
service that features small throughput and transmission range.
The former is based on the standard CSMA-CA protocol and the later
on the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol, which guarantees
a dedicated time slot for data transmission.
The communication facilities at the Base Station served to provide
Internet connectivity for remote management of the system
and potential full integration within the open environmental service
framework. The identification and localization of individual
humans, both those carrying mobile terminals and those without
them, within the area in which the RHEA system is deployed is
an important requirement.
The Base Station was the interaction point between the entire
system and the operator. The basis of this human–machine interaction
was a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for
system operation, monitoring, information record-keeping and
operation optimization. In the future, the GUI system will be
connected in real-time with the mobile units and will display the
current state of operations in 3D, i.e., it will show the position,
orientation, speed and status of every robot, aerial and ground unit.
It will allow the user to send instructions to the fleet of robots and
will include a simulation system to allow the user to rapidly test
new operations before the instructions are actually sent to the real
system or to test the results, in simulation mode, of an emergency
procedure initialized from the current real situation. This capability
will help to manage emergency situations in which the user
must rapidly define new operations in case of a problem (e.g.,
the failure of one robot).
Real-time kinematic (RTK) systems are the most accurate solution
for GNSS applications (2-cm accuracy). An RTK system
requires two receivers (a Base Station and a rover), a Wi-Fi
transmitter link and an embedded navigation controller that integrates
rover sensors and GNSS data to compute the final position of
the rover receiver (Misra and Enge, 2006). In RHEA, an RTK-GNSS
receiver was configured as a reference station placed in the Base
Station. This receiver offers centimeter-level accuracy based on
RTK solutions and sub-meter accuracy code-phase solutions.
Streamed outputs from the receiver provide detailed information,
including the time, position, quality assurance numbers and the
number of tracked satellites. The receiver also outputs a onepulse-
per-second (1 PPS) strobe signal that allows remote devices
to synchronize time information precisely.
The main task of the GNSS receiver on the Base Station is to
transmit the GNSS correction signal to each Ground Mobile Unit
to determine the location of the autonomous tractor accurately
(Fig. 4). The Center for Automation and Robotics (UPM-CSIC) and
University of Seville worked together to determine the GNSS centimeter-
level accuracy, through RTK signals, of the straight path
provided for the autonomous tractor.
The rover GNSS receiver was similar to the receiver situated in
the Base Station unit, but it enabled the calculation of headings
derived from dual-antenna GNSS measurements. The rover used
an RTK-GNSS correction signal from a local (located 0.3 km from
the test site) GNSS reference station to obtain RTK fixed-quality
accuracy. The rover receiver was set to output the ‘‘NMEA-0183
PTNL, AVR’’ string containing the geographic coordinates (latitude
and longitude) and yaw angle in degree and range (meters)
between the primary and secondary antennas at a 1-Hz rate via
an RS-232 serial connection. Single-antenna GNSS systems have
difficulty determining where the antenna is positioned relative to
the vehicle and object of interest, especially if the dynamics of
the target are not pronounced. Thus, independent observations
from both antennas were passed to the processor, where multiconstellation
RTK baselines were computed. A single connection
to the rover receiver via RS232, USB, Ethernet or CAN delivered
both centimeter-accurate positions and a heading accuracy better
than one-tenth of a degree (2-m baseline).

3. Design and development of pest control tools
3.1. Intelligent sprayer boom
An experimental sprayer was designed to deliver a variable-rate
application similar in concept to that developed by SAP (Carballido
et al., 2012) but modified to monitor the response time and herbicide
concentration in a variable-rate application in a direct-injection
sprayer. The herbicide sprayer boom sections consisted of
twelve high-speed solenoid valves (Model VC01, NTech Industries,
Inc., Ukiah, CA, USA), which were mounted on a stainless steel
sprayer boom with an equidistant spacing of 0.5 m. The solenoid
valves consisted of a 1=4
00 hose barb brass inlet for incoming liquid,
a spray nozzle, a nozzle cap, an LED indicator, a 3-pin electrical
connector (signal, negative and positive) and two captive screws.
The boom sprayer was divided into 12 sections, each containing
one solenoid valve (Fig. 5). Each valve was energized by a 12-V
source that allowed the spray from each section to be controlled
independently. The LED indicator was lit when the solenoid was
open.
A commercial central direct injection system (Model Sidekick
Pro, Raven Industries Inc., Sioux Falls, SD, USA) was equipped
with a water tank (200 L) and a separate container for the herbicide
(15 L) for injection according to the prescription ordered by
the system that generates the behavior of the tractor, i.e., the
High-Level Decision Making System (HLDMS). The boom controller
(SCS-sidekick) was handled by the HLDMS and the signal
inputs from various sensors. The HLDMS program, written in Labview
™, used the RTK-GPS position and the application rate map
information to determine the orders to be sent to the boom controller.
A UAV (model AR200, AirRobot GmbH & Co., KG, Arnsberg,
Germany) equipped with a multi-spectral camera, which is capable
of acquiring multi-spectral images at the desired locations
and times, was used. A specific algorithm allowed analysis of
the images to obtain application rate map information (Peña
et al., 2013).
An intermediate connection box was installed between the
sprayer and HLDMS to accommodate the signal sensors and to host
the injection system controller and the automation (PLC) device.
The injection system controller supplied a variable voltage to the
gear motor to power the injector pump. This voltage caused the
injector pump to turn at the appropriate speed to generate the
desired flow rate of the active ingredient. An encoder integrated
in the system measured the flow rate of active ingredient from
the injector pump speed. The controller used the active ingredient
flow rate from the pump speed to determine whether a change in
the flow rate of the active ingredient was required. The flow rate of
the active ingredient was verified using a mini-flow meter (model
508-2704, RS Components, Oxford, UK).
After all of the components were assembled on the implement,
the sprayer was tested in the workshop by simulating situations
that would occur under field conditions. This innovative system
included the mechanical (e.g., stability of the boom and hose
length) and electrical (e.g., cables, voltage levels, power and communication
equipment) subsystems, and it provided a variablerate
application based on weed infestation maps.
Laboratory and field tests were conducted during the winter of
2014. A 0.25-ha experimental winter wheat crop was selected for
this study (Latitude: 40.3140499 N, Longitude: 3.4842388 W). For
this preliminary evaluation, nine weed patches 3 m  3 m in size
were planted following a regular grid. With the configuration of
the autonomous tractor and sprayer boom shown in Fig. 5, the
accuracy of herbicide application (i.e., on/off time lag, % targets
sprayed, % target not sprayed and % non-target sprayed) was evaluated,
and the deviation of the autonomous tractor from its route
plan was determined with the aid of straight paper strips (see
Fig. 6).
3.2. Mechanical and thermal weed control system
The prototype was provided with five tools for mechanical
weed control and four units for thermal weed control. It was specifically
designed for wide row crops. Each thermal unit was composed
of a pair of 0.25-m-ide LPG (a liquefied mixture of propane
and butane) rod burners positioned to target one side of each crop
row (cross-flaming) (Fig. 7). The flame precisely impacted the
weeds growing in the ‘‘in-row’’ space (a strip of soil 0.25 m wide
with the crop plants placed along the centerline) and the lower
heat-tolerant part of the maize crop. All of the thermal weed control
end-effectors of each working unit were mounted on an
adjustable articulated parallelogram structure equipped with two
small pneumatic-tired wheels. During the treatment, these wheels
tracked the soil surface, maintaining the burners at the correct distance
from the ground.
This implement performed cross-flaming only if weeds were
identified by the real-time image-based detection system placed
on the autonomous tractor. This detection system discriminates
between crop rows and weeds in wide-row crops, working in real
time with the image acquired from a camera (model SVS4050, SVSVISTEK
Gmbh, Seefeld Germany) on board and under uncontrolled
lighting and movement conditions (Guerrero et al., 2014).
The pressure of the LPG was adjusted according to the weed
cover: no treatment if the weed cover was near 0%, low LPG working
pressure if the weed cover was less than 25% and high LPG
working pressure if the weed cover was greater than 25%. In fact,
the LPG feed was configured with two independent manual pressure
regulators to enable the setting of various LPG working pressures.
The purpose of this configuration was to obtain, at certain
Fig. 5. Prototype automated variable rate sprayer for real-time application.
M. Pérez-Ruiz et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 110 (2015) 150–161 155
constant values of working speed, various LPG doses per unit surface
area. During the treatment, the compressed LPG inside the
tank must be heated to induce it to pass from the liquid phase to
the gas phase. If the working pressure is high, the supply of heat
from the environment to the LPG will not be sufficient, and the bottles
will become too cool. If the temperature decreases below the
vaporization temperature of LPG at atmospheric pressure, the gas
stops flowing, and the flame in the burner will be extinguished.
To overcome this operational situation, the working machine was
equipped with a heat exchanger consisting of a cylindrical hopper
containing water heated by the exhaust gases (flowing in a dedicated
pipe) of the endothermic engine of the autonomous Ground
Mobile Unit.
During the treatment, the LPG tanks were placed in the hoppers
and partially immersed in the heated water. Given a volume of
water of 70 dm3 within the hoppers, the total weight of the
machine can range from 920 kg to 940 kg according to the type
of gas tank installed.
As in the case of the sprayer boom, the HLDMS sends to the controller
of this prototype the activating commands that operate over
Straight
paper strips

the burners in the appropriate locations while the plow operates
continuously between rows.
An important issue in research and commercial flame weeder
system technology is the consumption of LPG fuel. A simplified
simulation of a 16-row maize field infested with weeds was performed
to produce a precise flaming treatment. The crop rows
were divided into cells 0.25 m wide and 0.5 m long.
Moreover, during the field tests conducted in Madrid in 2013
and 2014 to integrate and optimize the functioning of the HLDMS,
LLAS, weed detection and the flaming systems, the effects of the
thermal treatments were evaluated on an artificial infestation of
Sinapis alba L. The flaming treatments were performed both at
early and late stages of development in maize (2-leaf and 5-leaf
growth stages) to evaluate both the degree of weed reduction
and the eventual damage caused to the crop plants. The effect of
flaming in the intra-row space was determined on 2-m long strips
and expressed as the percentage of weed reduction. The mechanical
removal of weeds in the inter-row space was also determined.
The damage caused by open flame to maize was visually evaluated
after the treatment, and the time eventually needed for recovery
was monitored.
3.3. Air-blast sprayer
An air-blast sprayer (model Oktopus from NOBILI S.p.A., Molinella,
Italy) with a 300-L capacity and a centrifugal fan, which
obtained 15 kW from the power take-off (P.T.O.) at an average
maximum hydraulic flow rate of 100 L min1 for the high-pressure
pump, was retrofitted for the precision application of agricultural
chemicals in olive groves, woody crops and orchards. It consisted
of two main vertical steel frames that supported two sets of spray
nozzles. The spray nozzles on each side of the hydro-pneumatic
sprayer were divided into four independent vertical bands with
separate chemical dose application controls. The upper and lower
spray nozzles on each side of the frame could rotate in a range of
0–30 to adapt the spray direction to the canopy size. The two central
nozzles on each side were static, as shown in Fig. 8. The fluid
flow in each spraying nozzle was controlled by double nozzles on
each spray module managed through two electronic solenoid-actuated
valve (model VE146 V, Parker, Etrromotori S.R.L., Ischitella,
Italy, each energized by a 12-V source), which allowed the spray
from each spray band to be controlled independently.
For the detection system, four active sensors (model U-GAGE
T30U, Banner Eng. Corp., Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used per side
to obtain noncontact distance measurements. These ultrasonic
sensors provided data on the canopy width of each vertical band
observed and operated in association with each solenoid-actuated
valve/nozzle. The sensors were positioned with an equidistant
spacing of 0.5 m on a steel rod mounted on the left and right side
of the sprayer and in advance of their associated nozzles by
approximately 1.1 m. The sensing range of the devices was 300–
2000 mm, with a sensing repeatability of ±0.25% of the distance.
The pulse frequency was 128 kHz. The window limits of the ultrasonic
sensors could be set with push buttons on the back of the
sensor or via remote programming. The logic of the detection system
ensured that when the canopy was detected, the measurement
was sent to the PLC (LLAS), which recognized the scenario
and consequently executed an instruction and commanded the
related actuator devices to manage the liquid and airflow (Fig. 8).
The airflow operation was performed by (i) eight butterfly
valves located on each pipe of the eight-fan collector calotte to
control the airflow rate in each nozzle, (ii) a main butterfly valve
in the inlet manifold to control the general air flow rate of the
pneumatic system and (iii) a variable inclination of the four spraying
terminal modules to improve the deposition in the sensitive
areas of the canopy. To automate the system, three types of kinematic
couplings driven by stepper motors (Lin Engineering Corp.,
Morgan Hill, CA, USA) were installed. These couplings were managed
by the motion controller (model DS3044, LAM Technologies,
Florence, Italy), which allowed accurate motor control of both
speed and position. Moreover, the motors were fully programmable
with the free User Datagram Protocol software (UDP Commander,
LAM Technologies Inc., Italy) and could be easily
interfaced with the standard Programmable Logic Controller
(PLC). The PLC allowed the monitoring of all sensors and instrumentation
systems together with the related algorithms.
To guarantee safe working conditions in the preliminary field
tests, it was necessary to ensure that the prototype sprayer only
moved forward on its wheels. At the end of each row or when it
needed to turn, it was necessary to lift the machine using the
three-point hitch lift. The maximum forward speed was 5 km/h;
the detection system did not operate properly at higher speeds
(see Fig. 9).
4. Preliminary results
4.1. Autonomous tractor prototype
The autonomous tractor was able to follow a trajectory based
on commands received by the HLDMS. These results validated
the ISOBUS communication and most of the software related to
the displacement of the autonomous tractor (i.e., steering controller,
Scenario1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4

presence of 50%?70% dose, scenario 3 presence of <50%?30% dose and scenario 4 absence of canopy?0% dose.

combine control module, brake controller, safety controller and
remote receiver controller). The actuation of the implements validated
the PTO, the hitch and the control of the rear electro-hydraulic
valves. The successful stopping of the tractor by the remote
control validated the safety controller and remote receiver.
Table 1 shows the RMS value and standard deviation for the
error performance of the GNSS receiver mounted on the autonomous
tractor in an RTK correction signal usage environment. The
GNSS receiver showed a horizontal accuracy of 2.5 cm and a vertical
accuracy of 3.7 cm on a continuous real-time basis. This level of
accuracy was expected because the RTK technique can determine
the sensor position within a few centimeters (Trimble, 2007). The
average RMS cross-track error of 2.4 cm in the RTK correction signal
system indicates that the passes were extremely straight, as
desired for the autonomous tractor. A between-row error with a
constant standard deviation was obtained, and the average value
of these errors for RTK was 1.43 cm. These results demonstrate that
the tractor controller was able to track each straight line with a
standard deviation better than 3.5 cm; the lateral position error
of the vehicle never deviated by more than 4 cm for RTK.
4.2. Autonomous variable rate boom sprayer prototype
The HLDMS-controlled sprayer boom has been successfully
developed. The HLDMS generated commands by reading a
prescription map and the geospatial position of the tractor to
determine the control orders for the spray valves in the fields. This
functional capability was also successfully developed. After all of
the components were assembled on the implement, the sprayer
was tested in the workshop by simulating situations that would
occur under field conditions. This innovative system included the
mechanical (e.g., stability of the boom and hose length) and electrical
(e.g., cables, voltage levels, power and communication equipment)
subsystems, and it provided a variable-rate application
based on weed infestation maps. The travel times from the injection
point to the nozzles were determined, and the data in Table 2
shows the time required for the flow in each scenario (275, 550 and
1100 L h1 applied flow rate). For the standard-volume application,
the distance between the injection point and nozzle caused a time
delay of 10 s. These results represent a significant improvement
compared with the results of Walker and Bansal, 1999, in which
the time delay exceeded 20 s.
The leadtime for herbicide injection prior to spraying according
to the weed maps was programmed into the HLDMS. This direct
herbicide injection system kept the chemical and the water separate
prior to the actual spraying, thus making the machine easier
to clean. The rate of application of the product can also be varied
according to the requirements placed on the system.
During the application field test performed to evaluate the
accuracy of herbicide spraying, a slight delay in the opening and
closing of the valves was observed (Fig. 10a). Furthermore, because
the cells to be treated were 0.5 m  0.5 m, the cells located on the
border of the patch were marked as treated if they had been partially
treated when the autonomous tractor reached them during
its first directional pass. Accordingly, the valve was not opened
again when the tractor returned to those cells (Fig. 10b).
The magnitude of the savings in this field test showed a dependence
on the percentage of the field that was infested by weeds. A
3.24% weed infestation resulted in a 96.65% savings of liquid
applied per hectare. Theoretically, a 10% weed infestation would
result in a savings of 90%, a 25% weed infestation would save
75% and a 50% weed infestation would save 50% of liquid applied
per hectare.

4.3. Mechanical and thermal weed control system
The three ranges of weed cover (see Section 3.2 for definitions)
were then associated with three levels of treatment. The frequencies
of the values of weed cover according to the three ranges are
shown in Table 3.
A simulated weed distribution map was constructed using the
weed coverage observed from these data. A random number from
1 to 100 was associated with each cell and used to assign the simulated
weed coverage to each cell. If the random number associated
with a cell was between 1 and 51, the weed cover in that
cell was considered to fall within the first range in Table 3; if the
random number associated with a cell was between 52 and 83,
the weed cover in that cell was considered to fall within the second
range; and if the random number associated with a cell was
between 84 and 100, the weed cover in that cell was considered
to fall within the third range.
Based on the information in Fig. 11, which presents the in-row
weed distribution map obtained with this simple simulation, the
three levels of treatment discussed above and a constant working
speed of 6 km h1, the estimated consumption of LPG per unit surface
area for precisely targeted flaming was 9.8 kg ha1. Thus, a
maximum LPG saving of approximately 55% relative to the treatment
of the entire surface is possible in this simulation. The estimated
cost for site-specific flame weeding is approximately
24 € ha1, whereas approximately 52 € ha1 are needed to perform
a conventional broadcast treatment. Thus, the use of VRA flaming
allows cost savings (28 € ha1) for LPG and, as a consequence,
reduced CO2 emissions in this example.
The preliminary evaluations conducted to verify the effectiveness
of the machine to perform weed control in the intra-row
space and the tolerance of maize plants to flaming confirmed the
excellent weeding effect, in terms of the percentage of weed cover,
of flaming performed both at low and high LPG pressures, as previously
shown by previous experiments conducted at the University
of Pisa (Peruzzi et al., 1996, 1998). The percentage of weed reduction
ranged from 95% to 99% if flaming performed at both the early
and late stages of the development of maize plants. In the interrow
space, as expected, all the weeds were killed by the application
of the mechanical treatment, again confirming the findings of previous
experiments conducted at the University of Pisa (Peruzzi and
Raffaelli, 2000; Raffaelli et al., 2005).
Thus, a weed reduction greater than 90% was obtained in both
the early-stage and late-stage physical treatments.
The evaluation of maize tolerance to flaming showed that, a
good and rapid recovery (requiring from 0 to 10 days) by the plants
treated with the two LPG doses used with high and low weed covers
was observed. This result again confirmed the findings of previous
experiments, conducted at the University of Pisa, which
also demonstrated that yield results were not affected by flaming
(Peruzzi and Raffaelli, 2000).
These results demonstrate that the field performance of the
Physical Weed Control implement was very good, allowing a weed
reduction of more than 90% without damaging crop plants. Accordingly,
any negative influence on maize yield was avoided.

previous partial treatment of the 0.5 m  0.5 m cells located on the border.

4.4. Air-blast sprayer prototype
An automatic air-blast sprayer that can be controlled remotely
by an autonomous tractor (based on a prescribed tree diagram)
or controlled by proximal sensors (based on the estimated canopy
volume) to open, close and move the spray valves was successfully
developed for a conventional tractor in the field and operated in a
working olive orchard.
The field tests performed during the design stage of the detection
system were conducted in olive trees with canopy volumes
ranging between 1 m3 and 20 m3 and at nominal speeds of 3.5
and 5 km h1. The tests compared two types of commercial ultrasonic
sensors (USs): a Banner model U-GAGE T30UINB US (range
300–2000 mm) and a Banner model U-GAGE T30UXUA US (range
100–1000 mm). To enable real-time detection in the four canopy
bands, the ultrasonic pulse simultaneous mode was used. The measurements
obtained using both sensors indicated several problems
resulting from changes in the reflection of the signal caused by the
low density and irregularity of the canopy and losses of the
reflected waves. The main problem detected was a delay in the
ultrasonic sensor response: the sensors were inactive for approximately
2 s during the transition from canopy detection to no detection
(out of operating range) to the next detection. Accordingly,
modifications were performed in collaboration with the Banner
company (the provider of the ultrasonic sensors). The new US configuration
reduced the refresh time to 200 ms. The ultrasonic pulse
simultaneous mode employed minimizes the response delay time
but generates a greater risk that crosstalk will occur among the
sensors. To solve this problem, the sensors were tilted at an angle
of 5 to the perpendicular structure of the support. The data
obtained show that the canopy volume estimated by these sensors
was not highly accurate but was sufficiently satisfactory to achieve
the desired goals. Preliminary trials were performed with a video
analysis to assess the correspondence between target detection
and spraying startup/shutdown at the beginning of each row, during
operation along the row and at the end of each row. The results
showed a precise system response to variation in the target features,
approximately 0.1 m of accuracy and a rapid actuation,
approximately 100 ms, of the management rules programmed in
the LLAS (PLC device) for the management of the spraying and
air flow rate adjustment. The data in Table 4 shows the mean values
of the total savings in liquid application for the three tree rows.
A comparison of these results shows that the savings produced
during application using the improved air-blast sprayer were
greater than 44% in all cases. The magnitude of the savings was
quite similar to that observed in other research projects (Gil
et al., 2007; Salyani et al., 2007).
5. Conclusions
The collaborative efforts in science and technology presented
here show successful project development and preliminary results
for new crop protection implements mounted on an autonomous
tractor. This prototype system is focused on the design, development
and testing of a new generation of automatic and robotic
systems for effective pest management for both agriculture and
forestry in both the chemical and physical (i.e., mechanical and
thermal) domains. The following conclusions were drawn based
on the results of this research:
– This study demonstrated the feasibility of using accurate geopositioning
information through RTK-GNSS for straight line on an
autonomous tractor where extreme accuracy is required. The
RMS errors of the location system were approximately 2.5 cm,
with a mean close to zero.
– The sprayer boom prototype could be used in precision agriculture
to implement site-specific management techniques for variable-
rate application of cereal production inputs using a mapbased
prescription. A system that allows the mixing of water
and herbicide during the treatment operation is essential to
avoid disposal of the excess product following the treatment
operation.
– The study showed that it is possible to obtain an autonomously
operating machine for the application of precision flaming. The
preliminary experiments show the viability of the use of an
autonomous tractor to carry different implements adapted to
precision treatment. For example, a high-level decision-making
system (HLDMS) on the tractor manages a spectrum of LPG
working pressures according to the level of doses contained in
a prescription map.
– In compliance with the new trends defined by CAP 2014–2020
and EU directive 128/2009 (limited and sustainable use of
chemicals) and rule 1107/2009 (promotion of non-chemical
methods), the VRA flaming machine allows the performance
of sustainable Physical Weed Control, guaranteeing the protection
of the environment, of human health and of food security.
The key problem to be solved involves the lack of standardization
of LPG tanks and the rules for their commercialization
and refilling in the EU. There are no rules for LPG storage
according to homologated provisions and no tax incentives
for the use of LPG in agriculture. Thus, there is a clear need
for political action to allow the definition of rules for the standardization
of LPG bottles and storage. This field of political
activity also clearly needs to acknowledge that in view of
the environmentally friendly nature of the agricultural use of
LPG, benefits should be considered for the farmers and the
contractors using flaming, particularly VRA flaming, to perform
weed control.
– The prototype air-blast sprayer is ready to utilize map-based
prescriptions and a data acquisition unit interfaced with an
air-blast sprayer to produce a variable-rate spray application
optimized to match the structural variation of the vegetation.
The system provides savings of approximately 45% in applied
spray volume. These savings, represented in terms of decreased
applications of chemicals, will not only reduce the cost of spraying
operations but also reduce the environmental impact
caused by these chemicals.
